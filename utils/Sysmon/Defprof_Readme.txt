DefProf updates the Default Windows User Profile with the documents and settings from another user profile that you specify. You can use DefProf on Windows 7 where the "Copy To" button is greyed out in the "User Profiles" dialog box.

Installation
Just copy DefProf onto your executable path, and type "defprof". You must have administrative privileges.

Usage
Usage: defprof profile_folder_name

 

Let’s say you use a ‘setup’ user account to create a user profile that you want everyone logging onto a machine to inherit. When you logon as setup, Windows creates a C:\Users\setup profile folder. To make ‘setup’ the default profile, you just type defprof setup at a command prompt.

 

DefProf 1.10 adds support for Windows 10.
